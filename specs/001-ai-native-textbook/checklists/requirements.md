# Requirements Checklist for AI-native Interactive Textbook Platform

## Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Specification includes specific technologies but as requirements not implementation details
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - User stories clearly articulate value propositions
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible and outcome-focused
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User scenarios, requirements, success criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3 prioritized) - All issues documented with priority
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Most requirements are specific with measurable outcomes
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - Specific targets provided (percentages, time limits)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - Outcomes focused on user experience, not specific implementations
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story includes GWT (Given-When-Then) scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Section covers various failure scenarios and unusual conditions
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (constraints + non-goals) - Technical constraints and non-goals clearly defined
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Technical stack and external services documented

## Feature Readiness
- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - FR-001 through FR-022 include specific behavioral requirements
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - P1-P4 priorities address core user journeys
- [x] Evals-first pattern followed (evals before spec) - Success criteria appear before functional requirements

## Formal Verification (if applicable)
- [x] Invariants identified and documented - Core system behaviors validated
- [x] Small scope test passed (3-5 instances) - Multi-user scenarios validated
- [x] No counterexamples found (or all addressed) - All test cases work with defined constraints
- [x] Relational constraints verified (cycles, coverage, uniqueness) - Entity relationships validated

## Additional Quality Checks
- [x] Consistent requirement numbering - Sequential FR-###, SC-###, TC-###, NG-### numbering
- [x] Prioritized user stories - Clear P1-P4 priority levels with justification
- [x] Measurable success outcomes - Quantified targets for user satisfaction, performance, accuracy
- [x] Technical constraints documented - API limits, character limits, user capacity defined
- [x] Non-goals prevent scope creep - Clear boundaries on features not to be implemented
